Incentive Cages
This repository contains research, simulations, and documentation accompanying the paper Incentive Cages. It focuses on the structural effects of incentive alignment in institutions, the advantages of peripheral actors unconstrained by these incentives, and the potential of human–AI symbiosis to overcome structural limitations.
Overview
Institutions—corporations, governments, NGOs—are bound by incentive cages. These are networks of career, structural, and reputational pressures that channel human effort toward maintaining system continuity rather than maximizing practical outcomes or societal benefit.
This repository explores:
How incentive cages form and constrain innovation.
The structural asymmetry between institutional actors and unconstrained peripheral actors.
Case studies, including crisis simulations demonstrating how simpler, decentralized solutions outperform resource-heavy institutional exercises.
The use of AI as a symbiotic amplifier to formalize, reflect, and accelerate human problem-solving outside traditional incentive frameworks.

Key Concepts
Incentive Cage
A structural phenomenon that channels human effort toward maintaining system stability, often at the expense of optimal solutions or societal benefit. Neutral in nature, it operates regardless of individual intent.
Peripheral Actor Advantage
Unconstrained actors outside incentive cages can iterate rapidly, explore unconventional solutions, and prioritize practical outcomes over internal metrics or profit.
AI Symbiosis
AI serves as an amplifier of human insight rather than a prescriptive authority. Neutral, non-coercive, and co-evolving, AI enables unconstrained actors to formalize and optimize solutions at speed.
Structural Asymmetry
Institutions may have superior resources but are constrained by incentive structures. Peripheral actors, even with minimal resources, can outperform in practical, harm-reducing solutions.
Usage
Researchers, analysts, and developers can use this repository to:
Study the structural dynamics of incentive-aligned institutions.
Explore AI-assisted problem-solving outside traditional hierarchies.
Replicate simulations demonstrating the asymmetry of incentive cages.
Apply human–AI symbiosis frameworks for practical, decentralized solutions.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome from anyone focused on neutral, outcome-driven exploration. Please maintain a clear separation between analysis and advocacy; the repository is designed to be a living archive, not a policy lobbying platform.
